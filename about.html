			<h2>Julia's Favorite Painting</h2>
			<p>This is a painting that was completed in Winter of 2013. I am personally a big fan of this painting because of the personal aspect; what's depicted is my family's home in Ann Arbor which I grew up in with all of my siblings. I felt the most apprpriate season to display was Winter because Michigan is known for it's vibrant Winters.</p>
